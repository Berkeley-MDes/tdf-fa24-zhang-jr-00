### 1. Understanding the structure and parameters

This week, my focus is on gaining a foundational understanding of the logic and structure of Grasshopper. As a first step, I am analyzing the provided example to break down its components and workflow. This analysis helps me comprehend how different elements interact and how data flows within the system.

### 2. Built with Grasshopper
I tried to test my understanding of Grasshopper. So I tried to built two other forms of Phone Stand.
The first one is built based on cylinder.
