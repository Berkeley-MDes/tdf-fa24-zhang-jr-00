### 1. Understanding the structure and parameters

This week, my focus is on gaining a foundational understanding of the logic and structure of Grasshopper. As a first step, I am analyzing the provided example to break down its components and workflow. This analysis helps me comprehend how different elements interact and how data flows within the system.
The following four pictures record the process that I try to see how logic works in computing different modules, and how parameters influence the shape and feasibility of the design model.

__A Short Summary__
The basic principle of Grasshopper, as I understand it, begins with defining reference coordinates to construct basic geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, or cuboids. These steps can be grouped into smaller modules. By calling these modules and performing operations on them, we can generate more complex geometries. At the same time, various parameters, like those of a smartphone, are defined as adjustable inputs. These parameters serve as a foundation for further refining the complex assemblies and performing validations, such as gravity checks. Once the form is fully developed and passes the tests, we obtain the final product.

### 2. Built with Grasshopper
I tried to test my understanding of Grasshopper. So I tried to built two other forms of Phone Stand.
The first one is built based on cylinder.

The second one is built based on Cone.
