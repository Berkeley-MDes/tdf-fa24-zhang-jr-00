# Week 11: Report 11 #
## Week of 11/7-11/14
### 1. Reflections

This week, I concentrated on refining the 'MINI ME' agent by integrating all previous enhancements with a real-time internet search capability. This final experiment allowed the agent to access both personal knowledge and current public information, resulting in a fully adaptive, context-aware digital representation. By balancing internal knowledge with external data sources, I achieved a comprehensive system capable of responding accurately and relevantly. This milestone marks the completion of MINI ME's transformation into a digital twin that provides personalized, timely insights in response to complex queries.4

To achieve a sophisticated and well-functioning "MINI ME" agent, I conducted a series of experiments to test and refine specific elements of its design and functionality. Each experiment was essential in advancing the model toward its final, high-performing version.


#### 1.1 RAG Experiment
The first experiment focused on implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) within the knowledge base. By experimenting with various data chunking and organization techniques, I was able to improve the agent's efficiency and accuracy in retrieving relevant information. This experiment highlighted the need for structured data flow, ensuring that the agent could generate coherent responses by accessing the most appropriate segments of knowledge.


#### 1.2 Achieving a Personalized Digital Twin with Comprehensive Insights
Through this configuration, MINI ME now acts as a true “digital twin,” capable of delivering nuanced responses that combine my personal data with relevant, up-to-date insights from the internet. When asked about suitable future projects, the agent suggested an interactive HCI installation, integrating my technical skills and ongoing research interests. This demonstrated the model’s ability to reflect my aspirations accurately and provide insightful suggestions.

3. Balancing Internal and External Knowledge Sources
The final experiment confirmed the utility of balancing personal and external knowledge sources. By using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Google search, the agent can retrieve personal information while staying informed of recent trends and developments in my field. This balance is crucial for creating responses that are both accurate and contextually relevant, as MINI ME now addresses questions with a well-rounded perspective.

### 2. Speculations

Looking ahead, I plan to refine the responsiveness of the facial expressions based on the data from the ultrasonic sensor. A future goal is to have the animations change dynamically based on detected distances, such as a surprised expression when an object is detected at a close range. Additionally, I aim to explore more complex animation patterns, such as multi-stage eye movements and detailed expressions. Integrating these features with the Photon 2's capabilities could lead to a more interactive and engaging robotic interface. The industry is increasingly focusing on human-like interactions in robotics, as highlighted in recent articles on adaptive user interfaces. Incorporating real-time data from sensors into responsive animations can position this project in line with these trends, improving user experience and functionality.
