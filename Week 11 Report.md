# Week 11: Report 11 #
## Week of 11/7-11/14
### 1. Reflections

This week, I concentrated on refining the 'MINI ME' agent by integrating all previous enhancements with a real-time internet search capability. This final experiment allowed the agent to access both personal knowledge and current public information, resulting in a fully adaptive, context-aware digital representation. By balancing internal knowledge with external data sources, I achieved a comprehensive system capable of responding accurately and relevantly. This milestone marks the completion of MINI ME's transformation into a digital twin that provides personalized, timely insights in response to complex queries.


#### Designing the Logic
This week, I tried to use the Stemma QT in my system. I first weld the related circuit, and then realized the basic funtion of the two Stemma QT sensors: APDS and IMU. The feedback on serial monitor shows the software and hardware both being set well and worked well.

### 2. Speculations

Looking ahead, I plan to refine the responsiveness of the facial expressions based on the data from the ultrasonic sensor. A future goal is to have the animations change dynamically based on detected distances, such as a surprised expression when an object is detected at a close range. Additionally, I aim to explore more complex animation patterns, such as multi-stage eye movements and detailed expressions. Integrating these features with the Photon 2's capabilities could lead to a more interactive and engaging robotic interface. The industry is increasingly focusing on human-like interactions in robotics, as highlighted in recent articles on adaptive user interfaces. Incorporating real-time data from sensors into responsive animations can position this project in line with these trends, improving user experience and functionality.
