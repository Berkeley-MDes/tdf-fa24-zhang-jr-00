# Week 3: Report 3 #

### 1. Reflections

This week, I learned to use Rhino and Grasshopper to explore parametric design principles, particularly focusing on organic shapes and fluidity. The use of Grasshopper enabled me to adjust parameters dynamically, allowing for multiple variations of the vase form. I also assessed the environmental advantages of using minimal support in 3D printing, which significantly reduces material waste and production time. The project is progressing well, and I am still keeping exploring the 3D printing process to optimize for efficiency.

__A Short Summary__

The basic principle of Grasshopper, as I understand it, begins with defining reference coordinates to construct basic geometric shapes such as spheres, planes, or cuboids. These steps can be grouped into smaller modules. By calling these modules and performing operations on them, we can generate more complex geometries. At the same time, various parameters, like those of a smartphone, are defined as adjustable inputs. These parameters serve as a foundation for further refining the complex assemblies and performing validations, such as gravity checks. Once the form is fully developed and passes the tests, we obtain the final product.

### 2. Built with Grasshopper
I tried to test my understanding of Grasshopper. So I tried to built two other forms of Phone Stand.
The first one is built based on cylinder.

The second one is built based on Cone.
