# Week 4: Report 4 #
## Week of 09/19-09/26
### 1. Reflections

This week, I learned to use Rhino and Grasshopper to explore parametric design principles, particularly focusing on organic shapes and fluidity. The use of Grasshopper enabled me to adjust parameters dynamically, allowing for multiple variations of the vase form. I also assessed the environmental advantages of using minimal support in 3D printing, which significantly reduces material waste and production time. The project is progressing well, and I am still keeping exploring the 3D printing process to optimize for efficiency.

Below are the final results of this week's work.

### 2. Speculations
I anticipate further exploring how Grasshopper can expand the scope of personalized designs by introducing more complex functions and parameters. I also plan to investigate how different materials and 3D printing methods might further reduce environmental impact. Additionally, I aim to research industry trends in sustainable design and 3D printing to apply them to future iterations of this project.
