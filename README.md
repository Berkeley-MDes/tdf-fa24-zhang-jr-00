# Github Background Information & Context
If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link!  As a start, feel free to simply add images to the `/assets` folder, which is located [here](/assets). 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/24f-desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions#weekly-progress-report). They might look something like this: ###

And I also focused on learning the basics of Rhino and Grasshopper. I followed the guidance provided, watching numerous videos to try out different functions within the software.
